Crying Lightning
================

A story driven experimental game written in C++ with OpenGL 3.3 and up, implimenting the GLEW, GLFW, SOIL, GLM, Assimp, and Boost libraries.

Developed on and for Linux, but due to the inherit nature of the libraries used, the code can be easily ported for cross-platform use.

Currently Working On:
================

+ Add keyboard and mouse input
+ Establishing a first-person "movable" camera
+ Implementing an OBJ loader
+ Begin modeling rudimentary terrain
